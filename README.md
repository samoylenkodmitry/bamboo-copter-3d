- ‚úÖ **Integrated spinning stick** with square grip for better control
- ‚úÖ **Multiple variants** - from lightweight 2-blade to optimized 3-blade designs
- ‚úÖ **Ready-to-print** STL files and complete printing guide
- ‚úÖ **Optimized for Bambu Lab A1 Mini** and PLA filament

## Quick Start
1. Choose your design from the available `.scad` files
2. Export to STL using OpenSCAD
3. Print with recommended settings (see [PRINTING_GUIDE.md](PRINTING_GUIDE.md))
4. Insert the square stick and enjoy flying! 

## Design Variants
- **`bamboo_copter_optimized.scad`** - Best overall performance with enhanced aerodynamics
